## Description of our GOAL and how we have operated
Starting from PTB-XL dataset, we have to discover if there are some connections between BMI and cardiovascular patholgies. 
Thanks to our dataset studies we discovered that there are lots of missing data inside it; for this reason we applied DATA IMPUTATION all over the dataset.
We use three different types of data imputation algorithms (linear regression, k nearest neighbors, miss forest) and we have found that the most effective is miss forest.
We plotted several graphs to better understand how the data were related to each other.

## Language and tools we used
- Python language - Jupyter notebook
- Canva for presentation.
